  <summary>Learning Log</summary>

- Effectively communicating and collaborating with a designer to build a website from scratch🤝
- Using developer mode in figma🧑‍💻
- Using Next.js 13 app router, and using `<Link>` and `<Image>` components instead of `<a>` and `<img>` tags🔗🖼️
- Defining custom types using TypeScript✅
- Using Tailwind to rapidly create layouts and basic styling🚀
- Making custom tailwind colors and using the `[]` syntax💄
- Soft resetting the head to undo the most recent commit, but not getting rid of the changes locally🧠
- Reverting git commits and resetting the head back to past commits🕜
- Adding files to past git commits that weren't pushed➕
- Adding files to past git commits that were pushed, and force pushing them➕➕
- Creating grid backgrounds using vanilla CSS⏹️
- Giving texts gradient backgrounds🟣🟡
- Creating better adaptive layouts with custom breakpoints🧐
- Creating a frosted Navbar❄️
- Creating a custom animated hamburger icon using hover groups, transforms, and transition timing functions🍔
- Passing states up and down parent and child components using the `createContext()` and `useContext()` React hooks🪝
- Creating more complex two-dimensional layouts using grid instead of flexbox⬛
- Creating a responsive ribbon in Tailwind CSS🎗️
- Making a footer that's fairly responsive and doesn't suck🦶
- Finally understanding how absolute and relative positionings work in CSS🤯
- Using the 'styles' prop in conjunction with Tailwind to add advanced inline styles, such as clip paths and svg rendering💅
- Using CSS clip path with the 'path' function to create custom cubic bezier curves for components🛣️
- Setting types for images that are expected as props inside a child component🖼️
- Making certain props optional using the '?' operator❓
- Using the [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/) React API to create image carousels🎡
- Customizing pagination bullets and navigation arrows in Swiper.js carousels🔨
- Relatively positioning html elements for hover effects🖱️
- Selectively merging certain commits from one branch to another using git cherry-pick🍒
- Using the `<a>` tag when using the 'mailto:' functionality instead of the `<Link>` tag. The `<Link>` tag is meant to interface with Next.js' file-based routing. Using it for 'mailto:' will result in buggy behaviour. In my case constantly opening the email whenever the page is brought back into window context📨
- Next's `<Image>` tag's `width` and `height` properties aren't necessarily for the actual size that the image will be displayed at. That's determined by the 'sizes' property⁉️
- Routing to sections in different pages using url paths in `href` tag🛣️
- Using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion) to add smooth, performant, customized animations🤸
- Routing to an id on different page and making the scroll behaviour smooth🧈
- Refactoring code can be a nightmare🤦‍♂️
- Dynamically rendering social media icons📸
- Using [react-countup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-countup) to implement a counting up effect for numbers when they're scrolled into the viewport⬆️

- Using [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) to debug SEO issues🕷️
- Generating a sitemap with a script to improve SEO🗺️
- Learning about DNS and configuring domains🌐
- Sending emails through code is a nightmare💀
- Using the [Resend](https://resend.com/home) email service to verify domain, generate API key, and implement a functional contact form📨
- Creating email templates for automatic responses from the [Resend](https://resend.com/home) server to user that filled out the contact form; thus providing confirmation that their message has been received by the team👍
- Using the [react-toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify) library to display notifications to the user once they hit the submit button on the contact form🔔
- Reducing bundle sizes through code refactor, resulting in improved performance🚀
- Carefully architecting a page before jumping into development. Deeply thinking about the html structure first🏗️
- Storing data in nested JSON files and accessing them📃
- You can't use for loops, if...else statements, and switch...case statements directly inside jsx🤯
- Setting custom screen breakpoints on Tailwind📱
- Adding calendar integration using the [Add to Calendar Button](https://add-to-calendar-button.com/) package📅
- Using `git merge main --ff-only` to merge commits from main to dev branch while avoiding merge commits✅
